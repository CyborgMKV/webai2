# README for 3D Models in WebGL Earth Game

This directory contains the 3D models used in the WebGL Earth game. The models are designed to enhance the gameplay experience by providing visually appealing and interactive elements within the game environment.

## Model Formats

- The models are typically in formats such as `.glb`, `.gltf`, or `.obj`, which are compatible with Three.js and other WebGL frameworks.
- Ensure that the models are optimized for performance to maintain a smooth gaming experience.

## Usage

- To use a model in the game, import it into the relevant component file (e.g., `earth.js`, `player.js`, etc.) using the appropriate Three.js loader.
- Adjust the scale, position, and rotation of the models as necessary to fit the game scene.

## Contributing

If you have additional models to contribute, please follow the project's guidelines for asset submission and ensure that all models are properly licensed for use in the game.

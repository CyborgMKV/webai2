## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Documentation & Organization**
- ✅ Moved `ultimateplan.instructions.md` to correct location (`.github/instructions/`)
- ✅ Consolidated `CONTRIBUTING.md` content into `README.md`
- ✅ Cleaned up redundant documentation files
- ✅ Updated file references and paths

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- ✅ Fixed weapon balance issues in `gameConfig.json`:
  - **UZI**: Fire rate `0.001 → 0.1` (reduced spam), Speed `2 → 20`, Lifespan `2s → 5s`
  - **Plasma**: Speed `20 → 30`, Lifespan `3s → 5s`
- ✅ Improved gameplay flow and projectile behavior

### 3. **Rapier Physics Integration**
- ✅ **PhysicsManager**: Complete physics world management
  - CDN + npm fallback loading strategy
  - Rigid body and collider creation
  - Collision event processing
  - Graceful fallback to existing collision detection
  
- ✅ **PhysicsComponent**: Entity physics properties
  - Shape definitions (box, sphere, capsule)
  - Mass, friction, restitution settings
  - Rotation constraints
  - Sensor modes for projectiles

- ✅ **Entity Integration**:
  - **Player**: Dynamic capsule physics with movement constraints
  - **Projectiles**: Kinematic spheres with sensor collision
  - **Shark**: Dynamic box physics with AI movement
  - **FlyingRobot**: Dynamic box physics for aerial movement

- ✅ **Game System Integration**:
  - Physics initialization in main game loop
  - Collision event processing
  - Entity physics lifecycle management
  - Pending physics initialization for late-loaded models
